### Threading Model

The heavy-I/O workers are coordinated via a `BoundedThreadPoolExecutor`, which caps concurrency with a semaphore and **allow task submission in bounded manner
from the main thread without blocking entire working stream**. Separate thread is checking status of all undone tasks from the executor and trace it to the log
to destroy job hanging illusion.

# 1. How to use TopPlaces job

- Frontend URL: https://maptile.osmand.net:4000/
- Jenkins job URL: https://maptile.osmand.net:8080/view/Wiki/job/Wiki_TopPlacePhotos/
- Set required environment variables (e.g., `MODEL`, `MAX_PLACES_PER_QUAD`, `PARALLEL`, `PHOTOS_PER_PLACE`, `MIN_ELO`, `SAVE_SCORE_ENV`) are described above.
- Either `QUAD` or `SELECTED_PLACE_IDS` must be provided.
- QUAD is used to filter places based on 'shortlink' field from ELO_RATING table.

## To score new images only in mix mode for all places.

- set QUAD string for quad search patterns which should includes one or more '*' symbol only. QUAD string pattern is number of '*' symbol to represent prefix
  symbols which built from "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_~" alfabet symbols. For example, QUAD="*" will go though A to ~.

## To "restore" photo to Safe photo setup SELECTED_MEDIA_IDS and its corresponding SELECTED_PLACE_IDS:

- set SELECTED_MEDIA_IDS to ensure certain media IDs are included for rescoring.
- set SELECTED_PLACE_IDS to ensure certain place IDs are included for rescoring.

## To "rescore" top photos by setup SELECTED_PLACE_IDS:

- set SELECTED_PLACE_IDS ensuring certain place IDs are included for rescoring.

## To adjusting score formula or changing prompt:

- To calculate total score in final table should be changed SQL in top_places_index_final_photos.sql file where there are hardcoded weights. Main logic is in
  SQL: "WITH CAST((s_value * 0.50 + s_technical * 0.20 + s_overview * 0.15 + s_reality * 0.15) * 1000, 'UInt32') as weighted_score". Setup scoring weights (0.5,
  0.2, 0.15, 0.15) to balance score's (value, technical, overview, reality) impact. Sum of weights should be equals 1.0.
- Setup SAVE_SCORE_ENV=1 to TEST and test prompt to be sure it comply to your requirements.
- Setup SAVE_SCORE_ENV=0 to PRODUCTION and rescore specific SELECTED_PLACE_IDS by using updated prompt.

# 2. How to use TopPlaces_Duplicates job

- Jenkins job URL: https://veles.osmand.net:8080/job/Wiki_TopPlacePhotos_Duplicates
- Set required environment variables (e.g., `PROCESS_PLACES`, `MAX_PLACES_PER_QUAD`, `PARALLEL`, `PHOTOS_PER_PLACE`, `MIN_ELO`) are described in global
  parameters's table above.
- To rescore some places or specific photos setup SELECTED_MEDIA_IDS and its corresponding SELECTED_PLACE_IDS (as described above)

# 3. How to build Final scoring

- Jenkins job URL: https://maptile.osmand.net:8080/view/Wiki/job/Wiki_TopPhotos_GenFinal
- Be sure all required photos are scored by using TopPlaces job in SAVE_SCORE_ENV=0 (Production)
- Be sure all required duplications are processed by using TopPlaces_Duplicates job
- Run Wiki_TopPhotos_GenFinal job
