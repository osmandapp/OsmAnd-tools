These polygons are meant to be used for address maps. They can be used to create normal maps for the USA and Russian Federations as well, but especially the Russian federation needs more detail at the Chines, Mongolian and Kazakhstan border. There are no addresses there but there are some roads overthere.

USA is including Alaska and the Hawaian archipel.

==For the time being these polygons will not be used. They are here for backup purposes==
